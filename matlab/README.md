# Entropy c-Means

This folder contains the MATLAB implementation of Entropy c-Means

## Usage of the MATLAB codes

1. The file 'run_ECM.m' runs ECM-NSGA-II and ECM-MOEA/D.

2. run_ECM.m reads the data sets from the 'datasets' folder.

3. run_ECM.m produces the output in the 'output' folder.

Note: The MATLAB implementation is less efficient than the python code.
